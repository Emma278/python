# My Python repo üêç

This is my very first coding repo. I am an absolute beginner in the coding universe, and strive to improve in everything I do, so if you feel like something lacks a finctionality that you would like to see, or if you feel that something should have been done in a different way, please leave a comment! Don't forget to explain why you think the change should be committed.
